	  references just fine, nowadays)

	  by Andrew Jones.  PlotPanel would register with the last toplevel parent
	  window instead of the first one, resulting in PyDeadObjectErrors.
	* PlotPanels now unregister their EVT_ACTIVATE handlers in OnDestroy,
	  making it possible to dynamically create and destroy them.

04-14-2006  Ken McIvor  <mcivor@iit.edu>

	* Corrected a grammerical error in plotit's help message.
	* AxesLimits.restore() now autoscales the axes when unzooming all the way
	  out, allowing you to add lines outside the initial plot limits while
	  zoomed in.

12-13-2005  Ken McIvor  <mcivor@iit.edu>

	  arrived.

	* Release: 1.2.1
