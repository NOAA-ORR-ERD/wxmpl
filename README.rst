Ken has not maintained this for a while, and is no longer at IIT.

WxMpl - Painless matplolib embedding for wxPython
-------------------------------------------------

The `wxmpl' module provides an matplotlib `FigureCanvas' with user-interaction
features like point-under-cursor and zooming in on a selected area.
Support for creating stripcharts, plots that update as their data changes, is
also included.

Documentation of the module itself is available in the`reference/'
subdirectory.  An introduction to using matplotlib with WxMpl is available in
the `tutorial/' subdirectory.  Scripts demonstrating some of matplotlib's
examples with WxMpl and plotting stripcharts data are in the `demos/'
subdirectory.
